# Test Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Successfully cleaned up test warnings and improved test output quality.

## Results

### Before Cleanup
- **Tests**: 331 passed, 2 skipped
- **Warnings**: 74 warnings
- **Main Issues**:
  - Divide by zero warnings in stereographic projection
  - Invalid value warnings in mathematical operations
  - PyVista mock warnings in tests
  - Overflow warnings in test functions

### After Cleanup
- **Tests**: 331 passed, 2 skipped (unchanged)
- **Warnings**: 22 warnings (70% reduction)
- **Remaining warnings**: Expected mathematical edge cases in test functions

## Changes Made

### 1. Code Improvements
- Added `np.errstate` context managers to suppress expected warnings:
  - `plot_3d.py`: Riemann sphere stereographic projection
  - `functions.py`: Stereographic projection and sawtooth functions
  - `colormap.py`: Chessboard pattern integer casting
  - `utils.py`: PyVista mock detection in tests

### 2. Test Configuration
- Created `pytest.ini` with warning filters
- Filtered expected mathematical warnings in tests
- Preserved important warnings for real issues

### 3. Skipped Tests
The 2 skipped tests are intentional:
- `test_raises_when_not_available`: Skipped when PyVista IS installed
- `test_import_error`: Skipped when PyVista IS installed

These tests verify error handling when PyVista is not available, so they're correctly skipped in our environment where PyVista is installed.

## Remaining Warnings
The 22 remaining warnings are all expected mathematical edge cases:
- Division by infinity points in complex functions
- Overflow in exponential functions with singularities
- Invalid values when evaluating at poles

These are inherent to the mathematical nature of complex functions and are properly handled by the code.

## Benefits
1. **Cleaner test output**: 70% reduction in warning noise
2. **Better focus**: Real issues are now more visible
3. **Maintained coverage**: No functionality was compromised
4. **Expected behavior**: Mathematical edge cases are properly documented
