*We cannot directly see the minute details of a Dedekind cut, nor is it clear that arbitrarily great or
arbitrarily tiny times or lengths actually exist in nature. One could say that 
the so-called ‘real numbers’ are as much a product of mathematicians’ 
imaginations as are the complex numbers. Yet we shall find that complex 
numbers, as much as reals, and perhaps even more, find a unity with 
nature that is truly remarkable. It is as though Nature herself is as 
impressed by the scope and consistency of the complex-number system 
as we are ourselves, and has entrusted to these numbers the precise 
operations of her world at its minutest scales.* ...

*Moreover, to refer just to the scope and to the consistency of complex 
numbers does not do justice to this system. There is something more 
which, in my view, can only be referred to as ‘magic’.*

## ✨ Features

- **🎨 Rich visualization options**: Phase portraits, enhanced phase portraits, chessboard patterns, and more
- **🗺️ Flexible domains**: Rectangles, disks, annuli, and custom domains via composition
- **📊 Multiple plot types**: 2D images, 3D analytic landscapes, Riemann sphere projections
- **🧩 Composable design**: Mix any domain, color map, and plot type
- **🚀 Lightweight**: Requires only NumPy and Matplotlib

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install complexplorer
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
import complexplorer as cp
import numpy as np

# Define a complex function
def f(z):
    return (z - 1) / (z**2 + z + 1)

# Create a domain
domain = cp.Rectangle(3, 3)

# Visualize!
cp.plot(domain, f)
```

## 🛠️ Advanced Example

```python
# Create an enhanced phase portrait with custom parameters
domain = cp.Annulus(0.5, 2, center=1j)  # Annular domain
cmap = cp.Phase(n_phi=6, r_linear_step=0.4)  # Enhanced phase portrait

# 2D visualization with domain and codomain side-by-side
cp.pair_plot(domain, f, cmap=cmap, figsize=(10, 5))

# 3D analytic landscape
cp.plot_landscape(domain, func=f, cmap=cmap, z_max=10)

# Riemann sphere projection
cp.riemann(f, n=800, cmap=cmap)
```
